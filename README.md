# BuyMyStuff

A marketplace to sell and buy products. Practically does not allow users to do real money transactions.
Users can be admins or ordinary users. Admins can put new items on the marketplace for sale and verify transactions. Ordinary users can review products and buy them.

Was deployed on Heroku but since the service became paid currently not available.
