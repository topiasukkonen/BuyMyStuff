# BuyMyStuff

A marketplace to sell and buy products. Currently it only serves as a premature version, which practically does not allow users to do real money transactions.
Users can be admins or ordinary users. Admins can put new items on the marketplace for sale and verify transactions. Ordinary users can review products and buy them.

This app could be made reliant on real money transactions in the future by adding some email identification procedure as part of the transaction process.
Thus buyers and sellers could communicate and make the transactions.
